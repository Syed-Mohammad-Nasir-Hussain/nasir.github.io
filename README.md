## PROJECTS :

### ROUNDING VNEXT
- **Problem Statement:** This project aims to create a sentiment analysis model capable of precisely categorizing the sentiment expressed in rounding notes documented by healthcare professionals during hospital rounds. The model needs to effectively analyze text data and classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, while overcoming challenges posed by the healthcare industry's domain-specific language, encompassing medical terminologies and abbreviations. Successful implementation of this model can empower hospitals and healthcare organizations to monitor the overall sentiment of patient care, pinpoint improvement areas, enhance communication, foster collaboration among healthcare professionals, and ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes.
- **Data Preparation :** Data selection aligned with model requirements, text preprocessing, and encoding techniques.
- **Model Implementation :** Utilized BERT, Roberta, Distil BERT, Roberta XLM, Vader, and AWS Comprehend; selected AWS Comprehend.
- **Results/Impact :** Achieved 80% sentiment prediction accuracy, empowering proactive negative feedback resolution, enhancing customer satisfaction, and increasing profitability.
